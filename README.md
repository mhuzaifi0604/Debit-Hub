under repository of Debit Hub.

If you want to Check the Application, Just Clone this Repository or download the folder `DebitHub-master`.
* Clone the Repository: `gitclone https://github.com/huzaifi0604/Debit-Hub/`
* Download the code if not clone the Repo
* Open Terminal and use the following commands
  - `npm i`
  - to run the application: `npm react-native run-android`  
  
It will take some time to initialize the application especially if you are using `Android Studio` to run the application. 
After the Application is successfully running you will see an interface something like this 2nd and Third are Sign in & Sign Up interfaces:

You can sign up for custmer panel with your own credentials. But for the Admin panel only the registered admins can access tye panel.  
For logging into the Admin Panel, You can email me at huzzaifaasim@gmail.com to get your own credentials.  
Logging into the Admin Panel provides the admin with an amazing interface loke this:
